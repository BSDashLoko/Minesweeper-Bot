 Python Minesweeper Bot that uses openCV
 
 It detecs a certain area of your screen, the corresponding area of a google minesweeper on hard difficulty, only the 24x20 grid.
 If you want to use this on your computer, make sure to change all values regarding to resolution and padding
 
 F to start

 Sometimes it willl either fail at the start when it clicks 3 spots or when its logic isn't sufficient and it goes for luck by clicking a random green spot and analysing the board.
